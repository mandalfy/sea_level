# Sea Level Rise Prediction

This project uses a dataset of sea level measurements and applies linear regression to predict the rise in sea level over time. It visualizes the relationship between the year and the sea level through a scatter plot and a line of best fit, extending predictions up to the year 2050.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the rise in sea levels based on historical data. We use the **EPA Sea Level dataset**, which contains the **year** and the **CSIRO adjusted sea level** in inches. We then apply linear regression to this data to fit a line of best fit, and extend the line to predict future sea levels.

## Files

- `epa-sea-level.csv`: The CSV file containing the historical sea level data (Year and Sea Level).
- `sea_level_prediction.py`: The Python script for reading the data, performing linear regression, and visualizing the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the dataset file `epa-sea-level.csv` in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script `sea_level_prediction.py`:

```bash
python sea_level_prediction.py
```

3. The script will display a scatter plot of the historical data along with the extended line of best fit that predicts sea levels up to the year 2050.

## Script Explanation

### Step 1: Import Libraries

The script uses the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas**: To handle data reading and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating the scatter plot and line of best fit visualization.
- **SciPy**: Specifically, the `linregress` function is used to calculate the slope and intercept of the line of best fit.

### Step 2: Data Processing

- The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame from the CSV file.
- Any missing values in the `Year` or `CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level` columns are removed using `dropna()`.
- The `Year` and `CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level` columns are converted to numeric values to ensure proper analysis.

### Step 3: Linear Regression

- The `linregress` function from **SciPy** is used to calculate the slope and intercept for the line of best fit based on the cleaned data.

### Step 4: Plotting

- A scatter plot is generated to visualize the historical data points.
- The line of best fit is extended from 1881 to 2050 to predict future sea levels, and plotted alongside the data.

### Step 5: Visualization

- The plot is displayed using **Matplotlib**, showing both the original data points and the extended line of best fit.

## Example Output

The script will generate a plot like the following:

- **Blue points**: Represent the actual historical data points.
- **Red line**: The best-fit line extended to 2050, showing the predicted sea level rise.
